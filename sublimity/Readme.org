sublime text風のスムーススクロール、ミニマップ、集中モード

smooth-scrolling, minimap and distraction-free mode (inspired by the
sublime editor)

** Screencast

[[screencast.png]]

** NOTE: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES IN THE LATEST VERSION

- sublimity-mode is now a global minor-mode, thus
  "sublimity-global-mode" is not useful anymore.

- sublimity-map is rewritten for better performance and following
  variables became no use.
  + =sublimity-map-on-scroll=
  + =sublmity-map-on-commands=
  + =sublimity-map-keep-commands=

** Installation

Require this script and some of "sublimity-scroll", "sublimity-map"
and "sublimity-attractive"

: (require 'sublimity)
: ;; (require 'sublimity-scroll)
: ;; (require 'sublimity-map)
: ;; (require 'sublimity-attractive)

then call command "M-x sublimity-mode" (or put the following
expression in your init file).

: (sublimity-mode 1)

** Notes

When you turn =sublimity-mode= on, "auto-hscroll-mode" is
automatically disabled, and "sublimity-auto-hscroll-mode" will work
instead. Therefore, to disable horizontal scrolling, set
"sublimity-auto-hscroll-mode" but not "auto-hscroll-mode".

** Customization
*** sublimity-scroll (smooth scrolling)

You may configure the speed of smooth-scroll by setting two variables.

: (setq sublimity-scroll-weight 10
:       sublimity-scroll-drift-length 5)

Scroll is basically divided into (weight + drift-length) steps. for
example, with the configuration above, 100 lines of scrolling is
divided into 15 (= 10 + 5) steps

: (17 15 14 12 11 8 7 5 4 2 1 1 1 1 1)

and it looks smoother than 1 step scroll. Note that last 5 steps are
all 1 line scrolls, because drift-length is set 5. So you may make
scroll more smooth by setting drift-length greater. try :

: (setq sublimity-scroll-weight 5
:       sublimity-scroll-drift-length 10)

With the configuration above, scroll is divided into 15 steps again,

: (30 24 18 12 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)

but the last *10* steps are all 1 line scrolls. this looks smoother
but perhaps more annoying for some users.

*** sublimity-map (minimap)
**** sublimty-map-size, fraction, text-scale

: (setq sublimity-map-size 20)
: (setq sublimity-map-fraction 0.3)
: (setq sublimity-map-text-scale -7)

"sublimity-map-fraction" defines the maximum fraction of width that
minimap can get. "sublimity-map-text-scale" is passed to
"text-scale-set" on minimap setup.

**** sublimity-map-setup-hook

: (add-hook 'sublimity-map-setup-hook
:           (lambda ()
:             (setq buffer-face-mode-face '(:family "Monospace"))
:             (buffer-face-mode)))

"sublimity-map-setup-hook" will run when minimap is created.

**** sublimity-map-set-delay

: (sublimity-map-set-delay 5)

With the setting above, minimap is displayed after 5 seconds of idle
time. When sublimity-map-set-delay is called with nil, then minimap is
shown with no delay. This defers from setting delay to 0, especially
when used with sublimity-scroll, in the sense that minimap looks not
deleted at all but gets worse performance.

*** sublimity-attractive (distraction-free mode)
**** sublimity-attractive-centering-width

: (setq sublimity-attractive-centering-width 110)

When a positive integer is set, buffer width is truncated to this
value and drawn centered. To cancel this feature, set this value nil.

**** sublimity-attractive-hide-xxxx

Following functions are available to hide some UI parts.

: (sublimity-attractive-hide-bars)
: (sublimity-attractive-hide-vertical-border)
: (sublimity-attractive-hide-fringes)
: (sublimity-attractive-hide-modelines)
